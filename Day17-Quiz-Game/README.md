# 🧠 Quiz Game – Day 17 (Python)

A command-line True/False Quiz Game built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.
This project is part of the 100 Days of Code – Python Pro Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu (Udemy).

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Quiz Game presents users with a series of True/False questions, evaluates their answers in real time, and keeps track of the score throughout the quiz.
The project demonstrates clean code structure, class-based design, and logical flow.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Command Line Interface (CLI)

## 📂 Project Structure
```
Day17-Quiz-Game/
│
├── data.py             # Contains quiz questions and answers
├── question_model.py   # Question class (data model)
├── quiz_brain.py       # Core quiz logic and score handling
├── main.py             # Program entry point
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## ▶️ How It Works

1. Questions are stored as dictionaries in data.py

2. Each question is converted into a Question object

3. QuizBrain:

  • Displays questions

  • Accepts user input

  • Checks answers

  • Tracks score

4. Final score is displayed after the quiz ends
