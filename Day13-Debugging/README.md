# Day 13 – Debugging in Python 🐞

This folder contains my Day 13 work from
**100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu**.

## Focus of Day 13
- Debugging techniques
- Identifying logic errors
- Handling edge cases
- Using print statements
- Exception handling
- Understanding debugger tools

## Why no single project?
Day 13 focuses on learning **how to think like a debugger**, not building a game.
Each file demonstrates a different debugging strategy.

## Skills Learned
- Python Debugging
- Logical Reasoning
- Error Handling
- Code Analysis
