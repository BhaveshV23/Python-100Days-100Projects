# 📊 Higher Lower Game (Day 14 – Python)

This project is part of **Day 14** of the **100 Days of Code – Python Pro Bootcamp** by **Dr. Angela Yu (Udemy)**.

The **Higher Lower Game** is a command-line game where the player compares two public figures or brands and guesses which one has more followers.

---

## 🧠 Game Concept

- Two accounts are displayed: **Account A** and **Account B**
- Each account has:
  - Name
  - Description
  - Country
- The player guesses who has more followers by typing **A** or **B**
- If the guess is correct:
  - The score increases
  - Account B becomes the next Account A
- If the guess is wrong:
  - The game ends
  - Final score is displayed

---

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` file
2. Observe the two accounts displayed
3. Type:
   - `A` if you think Account A has more followers
   - `B` if you think Account B has more followers
4. Keep playing until you guess wrong

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- Standard Python libraries:
  - `random`

---

## ✨ Features

- Clean and modular code structure
- Reusable functions
- Score tracking system
- Randomized comparisons
- ASCII art for better CLI experience

---

## 🧪 Sample Output
```
Compare A: Instagram, a Social media platform, from United States.
vs
Against B: Cristiano Ronaldo, a Footballer, from Portugal.

Who has more followers? Type 'A' or 'B': A
You're right! Current score: 1
```

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I practiced:

- Function creation and reuse
- Conditional logic
- While loops
- Dictionaries and lists
- Importing modules
- Code readability and structure

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add difficulty levels
- Store and display high scores
- Improve input validation
- Convert to a GUI version
