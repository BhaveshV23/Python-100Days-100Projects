# 🎨 Day 18 – Turtle Graphics & The Hirst Painting Project

This folder contains all the work completed on **Day 18** of the **100 Days of Code – Python Bootcamp** by **Dr. Angela Yu**.

Day 18 focuses on **Turtle Graphics**, helping build a strong foundation in graphical programming, randomness, loops, angles, and RGB color handling. The day includes multiple **practice challenges** followed by a **final generative art project inspired by Damien Hirst**.

## 🧪 Practice Challenges

Before building the final project, the following Turtle Graphics challenges were completed to understand core concepts step by step.

### 1️⃣ Shape Drawing Challenge

**File:** `challenges/turtle_challenge1_shapes.py`

**Concepts Covered:**

* Drawing polygons (triangle to decagon)
* Calculating angles dynamically
* Loops and functions
* Random color selection

This challenge helps understand how angles work when drawing shapes with Turtle.

---

### 2️⃣ Random Walk Challenge

**File:** `challenges/turtle_challenge2_random_walk.py`

**Concepts Covered:**

* Random movement in fixed directions (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)
* RGB color mode (`colormode(255)`)
* Thicker pen strokes
* Fast drawing speed

This challenge demonstrates randomness, direction control, and dynamic color generation.

---

### 3️⃣ Spirograph Challenge

**File:** `challenges/turtle_challenge3_spirograph.py`

**Concepts Covered:**

* Drawing circles repeatedly
* Incremental heading rotation
* RGB random colors
* Understanding angles and repetition

This challenge produces a colorful spirograph pattern and strengthens control over Turtle headings.

## 🎨 Final Project – The Hirst Painting

**File:** `the_hirst_painting.py`

The final project recreates a **Damien Hirst–style dot painting** using Turtle Graphics.

### 🔹 Project Features

* 10 × 10 grid of evenly spaced dots
* Each dot has a fixed size
* Colors are randomly chosen from a predefined RGB palette
* Turtle starts from the bottom-left corner and draws row by row

### 🔹 Optional Enhancement

The color palette can be extracted from an image using the `colorgram` library (code included but commented).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **turtle module**
* **random module**
* *(Optional)* `colorgram` for color extraction

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Programs

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed
2. Navigate to the Day 18 folder
3. Run any script using:

```bash
python filename.py
```

4. Click anywhere on the Turtle window to exit
