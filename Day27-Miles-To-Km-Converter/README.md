# Miles to Kilometers Converter 

A simple GUI-based desktop application built using **Python and Tkinter** that converts distances from **miles to kilometers**.  
This project is part of the **100 Days of Code – Python Pro Bootcamp** (Day 27).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** (Standard Python GUI library)

---

## ✨ Features

- User-friendly graphical interface
- Accurate miles to kilometers conversion
- Handles invalid input (non-numeric values)
- Clean and minimal layout using Tkinter’s `grid` system
- Real-time result update on button click

---

## 📐 Conversion Formula

`1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers`

The result is rounded to **2 decimal places** for better accuracy.
