# 🐢 Day 19 – Turtle Race Game

This project is part of the **100 Days of Code – Python Pro Bootcamp** by **Dr. Angela Yu**.  
It is a fun graphical game built using Python’s `turtle` module, where the user places a bet on a turtle and watches them race to the finish line.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

- Multiple turtles with different colors compete in a race
- The user places a bet by choosing a turtle color
- Each turtle moves forward by a random distance
- The first turtle to cross the finish line wins the race
- The result is displayed in the console

This project helps reinforce concepts like loops, lists, randomness, and basic game logic using Python graphics.

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Python `turtle` graphics
- Screen setup and user input (`textinput`)
- Lists and iteration
- Random number generation
- Conditional logic
- Simple game loop mechanics

---

## 🕹️ How the Game Works

1. The game window opens with six turtles lined up at the starting position.
2. The user is prompted to enter a color to place a bet.
3. Once the race starts:
   - Each turtle moves forward by a random distance.
   - The race continues until one turtle crosses the finish line.
4. The winning turtle’s color is compared with the user’s bet.
5. The result (win or loss) is printed in the console.

## 🧪 Example Colors Available

- Red
- Orange
- Yellow
- Green
- Blue
- Purple

*(Input is case-insensitive)*

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**

- **turtle** (built-in Python graphics module)

- **random** (built-in Python module)

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system

2. Clone this repository or download the project files

3. Navigate to the project directory

4. Run the game using:

```bash
python main.py
```
5. Enter a turtle color when prompted and enjoy the race 🏁

## 🚀 Possible Improvements

• Display the winner directly on the screen using turtle.write()

• Add a visible finish line

• Allow restarting the race without closing the window

• Validate user input more strictly

## 📌 Learning Outcome

This project provides hands-on experience with graphical programming and introduces the idea of simulations and simple games using Python.
